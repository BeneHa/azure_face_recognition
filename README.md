# Azure Face Recognition

This is a small project to use the Azure Cognitive Services, in this case the Face API, for face recognition. I had thousands of pictures of the last 10 years and needed to find some from specific persons, so this is how I did it.

If you want to replicate this project, here is my folder structure:


ğŸ“¦faces
 â”£ ğŸ“‚input_resized
 â”£ ğŸ“‚original
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚Person 1
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ train_img1.jpg
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ train_img2.jpg
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“‚Person 2
 â”£ ğŸ“‚output
 â”£ ğŸ“‚test_images
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œIMG1.jpg
 â”ƒ â”£ ğŸ“œIMG2.jpg
 â”— ğŸ“‚test_images_resized

 You need to put images in the "original" and "test_images" folder. Original images are the images used for trainig, test images are the ones where you want faces recognized.
